# MEMORY

2026-02-25 20:10 +0800 | decision | MEM-0100 | architecture,invariant | OpenClaw is the runtime source of truth; Shell Company focuses on UI mapping, visualization, and operator workflows.
2026-02-25 20:10 +0800 | decision | MEM-0101 | docs,invariant | Canonical docs indexes for this project are OpenClaw Multi-Agent Routing and OpenClaw Plugins pages.
2026-02-25 20:15 +0800 | decision | MEM-0102 | plugins,invariant | Notion integration is delivered as an in-repo OpenClaw extension (`extensions/notion`) instead of internal gateway code.
2026-02-25 20:18 +0800 | decision | MEM-0103 | ui,invariant | UI must preserve office/game visualization and only replace the data layer with OpenClaw state adapters.
2026-02-26 00:10 +0800 | decision | MEM-0104 | topology,invariant | Company/org metadata is stored in sidecar JSON (`workspace/office/company.json`) while OpenClaw runtime config contains only active agents/bindings.
2026-02-26 00:10 +0800 | decision | MEM-0105 | routing,invariant | Customer channel routing defaults to project PM agent, with optional per-channel agent override and reconciliation warnings for unmapped targets.
2026-02-26 04:40 +0800 | decision | MEM-0106 | ui,navigation,invariant | Office workspace navigation is tab-first (`team`, `session`, `skills`, `settings`) with a single app-store state source so scene interactions and settings modal always resolve to one active workspace context.
2026-02-26 05:55 +0800 | decision | MEM-0107 | ui,parity,invariant | For parity-critical workflows (chat, computer view, manage agent, training), ShellCorp uses dedicated Zanarkand-style modals with one-trigger-to-one-modal mapping, while OpenClaw integration is provided by thin frontend compatibility hooks until full backend parity is complete.
2026-02-26 06:35 +0800 | decision | MEM-0108 | ui,interactions,invariant | Employee radial Chat must always open ChatDialog above scene/context overlays, employee task routing must open Team Kanban filtered by responsible agent, and team-cluster clicks must resolve to Team Panel open state (not orphan store flags).
2026-02-26 07:20 +0800 | decision | MEM-0109 | ui,panels,invariant | Navigation is panel-first (no OfficeWorkspace overlay): top-left menu launches global Team/Agent Session/Skills panels and Settings option, while team/employee in-scene actions open filtered panel contexts for the selected entity.
2026-02-26 18:05 +0800 | decision | MEM-0110 | memory,invariant,openclaw | Agent memory inspection is file-backed per agent workspace (`MEMORY.md` + `memory/*.md`) and exposed in UI through employee-triggered Agent Memory Panel tabs (`list`, `search`, `graph-placeholder`) using `/openclaw/agents/:agentId/memory-entries`.
