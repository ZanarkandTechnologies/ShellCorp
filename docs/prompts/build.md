Copy and paste this into a new session to start a build pass.

---

0a. Study `@docs/prd.md`.  
0b. Study `@docs/specs/*`.  
0c. Study `@docs/progress.md`.  
0d. Study `@docs/MEMORY.md`.  
0e. Search code before assuming missing implementation.

- Build mode: pick one ticket from `@docs/progress.md` (up to 3 only if truly independent).
- Implement fully, then run backpressure commands (tests/typecheck/lint/build).
- Update `@docs/progress.md` with what changed and why.
- If you discover durable lessons/constraints, update `docs/HISTORY.md` and curate into `docs/MEMORY.md`.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` operational only; status and decisions belong in docs state.
