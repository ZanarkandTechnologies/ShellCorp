# Visual QA Report — Agent Memory Panel

## Expected UI Spec

- Reference spec: `docs/research/qa-testing/2026-02-26_agent-memory-panel-spec.md`.
- Core expected behavior: employee context menu action `Memory` opens modal with `List/Search/Graph` tabs and close controls.

## Observed Snapshot Report

- Environment: `http://127.0.0.1:5175/` using Cursor browser MCP.
- Landing page interaction worked (invite flow with code `Izunia`) and routed to `/office`.
- Office page interactive snapshot exposed top-level controls only:
  - `Back to Landing`
  - one collapsed unnamed button
  - unnamed button
  - `Show Logs`
- 3D employee objects in canvas were not surfaced as accessible snapshot refs, so employee click automation could not be targeted by ref.

## Diff Report + Verdict

- Verdict: `FAIL`
- Top 3 visual diffs:
  1. Memory modal was not observable in automation run (could not trigger employee menu).
  2. Expected tab strip (`List/Search/Graph`) not present in observed snapshot.
  3. Expected memory-row layout region not present in observed snapshot.
- Top 3 behavior diffs:
  1. Trigger step failed: no actionable employee ref exposed by snapshot tooling.
  2. Modal open/close behavior unverified due trigger failure.
  3. Search and graph-placeholder behavior unverified due trigger failure.
- Severity: `major` (testability blocker, not yet confirmed as product defect).

## Fix Plan

- Add one deterministic non-canvas QA trigger for memory panel in dev mode (e.g., temporary debug button in HUD that opens memory panel for selected/default agent).
- Or expose canvas pick actions via test id hooks that can be driven without freeform coordinates.
- Re-run full visual QA with geometry checks once modal is reachable in automation.

## Artifacts

- MCP action log: browser snapshots taken on `/` and `/office` in this run.
- Intended screenshot capture (`agent-memory-panel-office-before.png`) timed out twice in MCP and is unavailable.
